## Handa <-> Prepared
At this year's [IRCIEST](https://irciest.batstateu.edu.ph/) PROPEL Exhibition, Paglalayag had the chance to display the latest prototype of **Abangan Bubog Okasyonal (A.B.O.)**, an automated ashfall collector advanced to prototype stage by [ASTI's Electronics Prototyping and Development Centre](https://asti.dost.gov.ph/projects/epdc/).

You can review the poster here:

Despite threat looming, ongoing public safety threat that Taal poses to the people of Batangas, it is also a `rare gem, living laboratory and national treasure`.

Disaster response is primarily a government function.  But here at Paglalayag, we also recognise the value of `developing prepared minds and communities`.

We don't know how this project will evolve going forward but look forward to working to engaged citizens with a keen interest and love for the natural sciences, to develop better `disaster preparedness plans/programs for vulnerable and potentially affected Filipino communities` in the coming years.

Perhaps there will also be opportunities & appetite for `citizen-administered volcano monitoring installations` in the future.

Tuloy tuloy lang!!
