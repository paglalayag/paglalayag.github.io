## PhRUG is hitting the road...maps!

This month, we issued a `DESIGN CHALLENGE` to the community!


```
How might we form the PhRUG cave to:
 - Forge new friendships?
 - Uncover rich seams to prospect?
 - Harden our Filipino Rubyists?
 - Crystallize this skills?
 - Combine & compound their talents?
 - Help them continue to shine at all stages of their lives and careers?
```
