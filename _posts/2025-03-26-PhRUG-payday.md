## PhRUG is Cashin' In!
[PayMongo](https://www.paymongo.com/) hosted our 3rd Meetup of the year.  Many thanks to the team!

### Challenge
We went a bit more object oriented in our code golf challenge with [Number Spiral](https://code.golf/number-spiral#ruby).

### Talks
Al was playing around with some refactoring tools like [flog](https://ruby.sadi.st/Flog.html) mentioned in the ThoughtBot book [RubyScience](https://github.com/thoughtbot/ruby-science/).
