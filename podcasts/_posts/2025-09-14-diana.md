[Diana PÃ¡ez is Senior Director, Energy & Mobility at the William Davidson Institute](https://wdi.umich.edu/people/diana-paez/). where she helps energy and mobility businesses and stakeholders in low and middle-income countries take advantage of business opportunities and adapt to changes brought about by the energy transition. With a special focus on what they are calling a 'Just Transition'

Last month, Diana and her team at WDI released a report titled:
[Driving a Just Transition to E-mobility in the Philippines](https://wdi.umich.edu/news/how-e-mobility-is-accelerating-in-the-philippines/)

WDI has a bit of a celebrity team together on this by teaming up with ADB and the [Apl.de.Ap Foundation](https://www.aplfi.org/) which bear the name of its founder of Black-Eyed Peas fame.

This report (and planned Centre of Excellence) is of great interest to the team at Paglalayag and sunE.  So that's what we sat down to talk about in this episode.
