## PhRUG is hitting the road...maps!

This month, we had a bit of a hiccup regarding venues leading to some very last minute planning.  However, I also had the chance to pull in some globally minded fresh new faces after my presentation at [De La Salle's SDG Summit](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=501314746209136&set=pcb.501315232875754)

Thankfully, [Narra](https://www.narralabs.com) came through for us in a pinch!

The topics we discussed will set the scene for a better organised [PhRUG](https://www.meetup.com/ruby-phil) into 2025.

Tuloy Tuloy Lang!!
