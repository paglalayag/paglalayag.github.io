## PhRUG is back under the umbrella tree!
[Narra](https://www.narralabs.com/) has us rolling again.  Many thanks to the team who has really held the fort at PhRUG this year!

### Fine tuning and deploying LLMs for use in your apps 
Ray from [Narra](https://www.narralabs.com/) showed us how to upgrade an off the shelf image regognition model to better handle your specific images.  He deployed a [receipt scanning model specially tuned for Filipino receipts](https://huggingface.co/raymartml/qwen-2.5-vl-7b-receipt-gguf)

### Redis vs SolidCache
Al showed the what's involved in the migrating from Redis to [SolidCache](https://github.com/rails/solid_cache) via the livechat feature of the [Rails & Hotwire Codex](https://ayushn21.gumroad.com/l/railshotwirecodex).  PhRUG has discounted copies if you want to check it out.
