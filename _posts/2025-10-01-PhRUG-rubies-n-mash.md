## PhRUG is Gettin' Mashed!
We had another charming night at [Mashup Garage](https://www.mashupgarage.com/). Many thanks to Jason and the team and best of luck to his new initiative at [BetterGov](https://bettergov.ph)!

### Git 
Lyzh from [Narra](https://www.narralabs.com/) gave a talk packed full of git protips.  Not just in terms of tool choice but also new commands and workflows.

If you primarily know git via clicking around the github website or your code editor, this will definitely broaden your horizons.

### SimpleCov MCP server
Then, calling in from Mindanao, Keith Bennett gave us a test drive of the [MCP gem he developed for on of ruby's TDD workhorses, simplecov](https://github.com/keithrbennett/simplecov-mcp)

It surfaced some interesting discrepancies between the MCP spec and the implementation of a major agent provider.

### MCP on a big transport DB - Part 2
Al presented the second episode about his journey into buildng a Model Context Protocol server on a big fat juicy transport database
