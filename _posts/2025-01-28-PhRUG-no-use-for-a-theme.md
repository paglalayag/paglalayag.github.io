## PhRUG kicks off the year with an e-commerce angle!

For the first Meetup of the year, we started off with an intro to Paglalayag's recently published open-source template got Bridgetown.
It's meant for helping people get a minimalist build up and running fast to start selling online.

A sample can be viewed at [http://spoi.paglalayag.net/](http://spoi.paglalayag.net/)

While the plugin and setup instructions are available
[here](https://github.com/paglalayag/bridgetown_theme_single_page_opt_in/)

We also tried our hand at [Gijswijts Sequence](https://code.golf/gijswijts-sequence#ruby).  It was tricky just to understand the sequence itself.  So nobody go it during that evening.

We also had a demo from David Ang about launching an eCommerce website using [Spree](https://spreecommerce.org/).

It was a good turnout to open 2025 on. Keep an eye on the PhRUG [meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/ruby-phil) and [FB group](https://www.facebook.com/phrug).

Tuloy Tuloy Lang!!
