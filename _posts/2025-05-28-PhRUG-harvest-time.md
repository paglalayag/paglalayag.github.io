## PhRUG is enjoyin the fruits!
[Narra](https://www.narralabs.com/) was our shady grove for this month!

### Materialized Views
Ejay from [Narra](https://www.narralabs.com/) walked us through some very tricky db calls and performance tradeoffs that he eventually solved with [Materialized Views](https://pganalyze.com/blog/materialized-views-ruby-rails).  This is getting pretty deep into the db weeds and you really need to watch yourself when applying these kinds of techniques on your production data.

### hotwire native
Al has been poking away at a multiplatform native client for the Paglalayag podcast so he walked through the intial progress of this effort.

Keep an eye on the PhRUG [meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/ruby-phil) and [FB group](https://www.facebook.com/phrug).

Tuloy Tuloy Lang!!
