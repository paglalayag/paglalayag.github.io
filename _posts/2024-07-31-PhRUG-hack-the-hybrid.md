## Video Highlights

We spent a bunch of time streamlining the onboarding of new contributors to the [community webRTC app](https://gitlab.com/phrug/hybrid-meetup-experiment),

Then, towards the end, the community presented 2 gems:
 - **1:50:00** - [i18n-ai](https://github.com/narralabs/i18n-ai), an api tool for using ai to automagically generate/update your i18n files to different languages.  Courtesy of [Narra Labs](https://www.narralabs.com/) 

 - **2:15:30** - A gem for generating random affirmations (positive messages of encouragement & persistance)

Finally I gave a short talk at:
 - **2:02:00** - about my thoughts on how to draft a [DICT Startup Grant Fund application](https://dict.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DC-001-s.-2023-Startup-Grant-Fund-Guidelines.pdf) for a project intended for open-source licensing (unprecedented at this time)
