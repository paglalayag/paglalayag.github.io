I'm told that there are a lot of eyes on Batangas State University since it took on the mantle of **National Engineering University**.

Well, Mark made a solid choice by standing on the shoulders of one of the Higantes of Electronics, Dr Leon Chua.

-----------------

Dr Chua started out as a pioneer of Chaotic electronic systems.  Which is the focus of today's interview.  After chatting with Mark and reading about his later carreer accolades in the field of Neural Networks, I wonder how much he foresaw these fields getting intermingled into the future.

Well, Mark is bringing that future closer as he brings in an ML-model to predict and control this classic circuit.

I've always had a soft spot for fractals and mathematical chaos.  So this may have been more of a treat for me than my audience :D.  But hopefully y'all can appreciate the beauty within these mathematical pursuits.
