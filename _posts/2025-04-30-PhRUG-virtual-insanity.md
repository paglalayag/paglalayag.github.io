## PhRUG is Goin' Bonkers!
[ProudCloud](https://www.proudcloud.io/) hosted our 4th Meetup of the year.  Many thanks to Jay and the team!

### Shapeup
Leif from [Narra](https://www.narralabs.com/) gave a talk about 37Signals's [Shapeup](https://basecamp.com/shapeup).  It has some similarities to the popular Agile methodology, but with not such a frantic pace and arguably less management involved.

### Redis vs SolidCache
Al showed the what's involved in the migrating from Redis to [SolidCache](https://github.com/rails/solid_cache) via the livechat feature of the [Rails & Hotwire Codex](https://ayushn21.gumroad.com/l/railshotwirecodex).  PhRUG has discounted copies if you want to check it out.

### Prizes
[Obie Fernandez](https://obiefernandez.com/) was kind enough to provide a couple copies of 
![Patterns of Application Development using AI](https://leanpub.com/patterns-of-application-development-using-ai) as our prize for attendees this month.  Stay tuned for more cool updates on that front!
