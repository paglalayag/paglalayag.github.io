## PhRUG follows up with a meta-straight!

For the second Meetup of the year, we dove deep into metaprogramming by revisiting [Gijswijts Sequence](https://code.golf/gijswijts-sequence#ruby).  

Al shared a step-by-step on how to solve it with even less characters, using meta-programming techniques.
