This is a pretty substantial program for this Circular Economy sector.  I've seen many teams, projects and proposals come and go over the years.  There is definitely strong public desire to address issues like plastic waste.

The **Green up to Scale up** program seeks to build capacity amongst Entrepreneur Support Organizations who can provide additional stability, resources and opportunity for those who dare to take the plunge into entrepreneurship.

But it's not only for those delivering the programs.  The ESOs will also be able to offer grants to their participating startups.  So if you are actively building Circular Economies.  This will be one for you to pay attention to.

### Background

Green Up to Scale Up is made possible through the Green Economy Programme in the Philippines. Funded by a ‚Ç¨60 million (P3.67 billion) grant from the European Union in the Philippines, the Green Economy Programme in the Philippines (GEPP) will run from 2023-2028 in collaboration with the national government, local government units (LGUs), and the private sector. 

The Programme links European and Filipino partners to foster a circular economy and the reduction of plastic waste. It also aims to improve energy efficiency, promote renewable energy use and climate change mitigation and adaptation. Using a whole-of-nation approach, the programme is focused on sustainable and inclusive growth through investments, technology transfer, and job creation. 

GEPP is implemented by Expertise France with Global Green Growth Institute, UNDP Philippines, Germany‚Äôs development agency GIZ, and the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank Group.
