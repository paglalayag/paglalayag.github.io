Dean Berris is one of those software engineers who takes on hard problems and solves them.

As an early engineer into Friendster during its heydays, he had some very hard problems on his desk. Problems that were being tackled for the first time and were redefining how people use the internet.

It's not just about technical excellence.  There's no replacement for grit and determination, qualities I've seen from Dean since I first started interacting with him.
