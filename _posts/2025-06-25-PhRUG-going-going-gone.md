## PhRUG lost its marbles!
We opted to meet online this month but didn't do such a good job with the papertrail! It's all gone ;)

### Deploying Rails infra
Ken from [Narra](https://www.narralabs.com) showed off a pretty slick workflow for deploying Rails from Scratch including some protips for: VPS, Docker, HAProxy & SSL

### Multiplatform & hotwire-native integration demo
Al's demo was showing the initial setup of local storage for a [hotwire-native](https://github.com/hotwired/hotwire-native-ios) app.  So there was some chat about what to do next (generators, etc).

Also, Dustyn, a recent High School graduate told us about his experiences during his Work Immersion Program learning how to install & use Rails on Windows Subsystem for Linux.

Keep an eye on the PhRUG [meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/ruby-phil) and [FB group](https://www.facebook.com/phrug).

Tuloy Tuloy Lang!!
