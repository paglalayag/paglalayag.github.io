## PhRUG is Takin er eezy!
[Benilde HiFi](https://www.facebook.com/benildehifi/) We had a splendid evening at Hifi this month!  Many thanks to Paul for accommodating!

### Test Driven Development
George from [Narra](https://www.narralabs.com/) gave a a nice solid rundown on how you can get rolling with Test Driven Development.  
Rubyists have always benefitted greatly from the very nice and robust test frameworks (including many from PhRUG).

### Takin Rails into Android & iOS
Al had a fun chat and livedemo with [Joe Masilotti](https://masilotti.com/), a core contributor of [Hotwire Native](https://github.com/hotwired/hotwire-native-android/) and author of the recently published Prag Prog book on the subject.
Al's recent project was a [demo app integrating hotwire-native with  using Compose Multiplatform](https://github.com/paglalayag/cmp-hotwire-demo/).  This aloowed for building local storage into a common codebase to be accessed by both the android and ios clents.
